:: MetaWhich

This tool attempts to bring together a number of SIBR projects, to help folks find "that one thing I know I saw somewhere". It's brought to you by Kawa. Individual tool makers are invited to add or update info on their own tools! 

[[Source here|https://github.com/kawa-kitsuragi/whichtool]]. You can use the GitHub issues to report issues, or @@.channel;#projects@@ in 'Getting Involved'.
