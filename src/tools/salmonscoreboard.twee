:: SalmonScoreboard

Salmon, under Salmon Weather (as of Season 15), steal runs by swimming upstream. [[This page|https://hora.github.io/blaseball-scoreboard/]] shows every game the salmon were in, and how many runs they took, as if they were a third team on the field. A white triangle indicates the ILB winner of the game; a pink triangle notes that the salmon had more Runs than at least one ILB team.
