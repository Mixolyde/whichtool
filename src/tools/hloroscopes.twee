:: Hloroscopes

[[Hloroscopes|https://hloroscopes.sibr.dev]] plots how teams' and players' stars change over time (after events like blood drains, blessings, and the like). It's brought to you by yooori.

It includes toggles for Forbidden Knowledge and apple-stat changes and spacing of the x axis. If you select a team, the 'History' button shows team composition changes over time. [[Source here|https://github.com/teagrrl/astrology/tree/master/hloroscopes]].
