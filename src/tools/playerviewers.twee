:: PlayerViewers

The current "best source" for apple stats (such as divinity and shakesperianism) is [[this player viewer|https://blaseballplayers.netlify.app/]]. It features robust searching and filtering, the ability to save subsets of players for easy comparison, as well as noting additions/subtractions due to items in italics.

It's brought to you by Astrid, and it's currently a work in progress. [[Contribute to the source here|https://github.com/xSke/blaseball-player-list]].

If you'd like, you can also support Astrid's efforts directly through her [[Patreon|https://www.patreon.com/floofstrid]].

There's also [[Astrology|http://yoori.space/astrology/]] from yoori - it does not have the search/filter functions, but does include derived ratings along some metrics, modifications, and fast load times. (Combined stars are shown by default; there's a toggle on the bottom for individual apple stats.)

Notably, the newest player viewers currently do not have alternate color schemes for colorblindness, and right now, Astrid's is only available in light mode. If you require that, try [[Abslve|https://slavfox.space/abslve/#SUN]] or [[the original viewer|https://stlats.sibr.dev]], but neither are in active development and may have unusual behavior (e.g. including Coffee Cup teams mixed with ILB teams, not reflecting items).
