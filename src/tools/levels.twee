[[S24 Navigation|https://faculty.sibr.dev/~honu/navigation.html]] provides historical traces of how teams have navigated around the 2D field provided in Season 24, between the Hall, Vault, Desert, and Horizon during the finale of the Expansion Era. Built by honu.

[[Levels|https://levels.sibr.dev]] graphs each team's "imPosition" over time - the y position on the Depth chart (the predecessor to the Map), a variable that determines "credit rating" (e.g. 1D, Low A) and thus possibility of Consumer attacks. You can select for specific teams as well as the "noodle", a league-wide factor based on eDensity of idols. There's also a slider on the bottom to see different seasons' values. 

It's brought to you by ubuntor. Source [[here|https://github.com/ubuntor/blaseball_imposition]]. Deeper discussion of immateria physics and eDensity is in @@.channel;#edensity-and-immateria-physics@@ - you'll need the "ðŸ“– Research" role in @@.channel;#roles-and-sigils@@ to see it.
