:: SteveWriteup
There are many ways to enjoy blaseball‚Äîall valid. Some fans simply bet on matches. Others eagerly discuss their favorite teams and generate entire backstories for their players. There are fans who compile statistics, or draw fan art, or both.
[[And some fans uncover hidden secrets in 25-year-old salmon modeling software.|https://salmon.sibr.dev/steve.html]]

Honu discussed the salmon saga on Blaseball Sunday, if you prefer to [[listen to the interview|https://youtu.be/L2poaPBgRmg?t=3065]].

:: salmon_lib
SIBR's salmon sages have the tool for you: [[salmon_lib|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/salmon_lib]]

:: webcrisp
We built a JSON API for 1995 salmon software. [[You can find it here.|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/webcrisp]]

The University of Washington School of Fisheries Columbia Basin Research Group very generously sent us the code for CRiSP Harvest v 3.0.6, which we have [[mirrored on Github for research and archival|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/crisp]].

Due to particular C++ dependencies, it currently does not compile - if you have any resources on RogueWave, please get in touch with us in @@.channel;#crisp@@!

''Please keep in mind:'' [[Salmon Steve|SteveWriteup]]'s identity is in this code. We can't, like, edit that out, but out of respect to his privacy please avoid including mentioning his last name, beyond the first initial. Steve U. is fine.
