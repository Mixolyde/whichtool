:: Yuuko

Ever wanted Yuuko from the hit anime Nichijou to tell you how bad your favourite blaseball player is at managing salmon fisheries, according to software from 1995?
Well, uh, now you can.

/* Turns out the guidelines are somewhat different for our fishy friend.*/ Visit us [[on the server|https://discord.sibr.dev]], pick out a role in @@.channel;#roles-and-sigils@@, then head to @@.channel;#bot-crimes@@ in 'Salmon' to use the bot. Development questions and bug reports can be brought up in @@.channel;#crisp@@, also in 'Salmon'.

Yuuko is made by allie (sapphicfettucine/alisww), using the CRiSP Harvest Model and salmon_lib. [[Find the source code here|https://github.com/alisww/yuuko]].
