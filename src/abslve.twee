[[Abslve|https://slavfox.space/abslve/#SUN]] shows you star ratings for any player, by team. 

You can click the "Want that Forbidden Knowledge?" link at the bottom for unrounded stars and "apple stats", such as ruthlessness and shakesperianism. From there, you can click that "most Forbidden Knowledge" link to also see these stats for players in the Shadows.

It's robust, but somewhat unwieldy and not being actively maintained. (Indeed, its Forbidden Knowledge barriers are reflective of a time before the Apple.) A new version of this is in the works by other developers, but this is the best source we have now.

Its source code is [[here|https://github.com/slavfox/abslve]].
