:: UserStyles

[[Blaseball Compact|https://thevdude.github.io/BlaseballCompact/]] is a Stylus userstyle to fit blaseball games during the regular season in a 3 x 4 grid. Consumer Contrast (at the same link) makes CONSUMERS stand out more on the page. Both are brought to you by theVdude.

[[Emoji fix|https://holmesmr.github.io/Blaseball-Userstyles/]] is another Stylus userstyle to fix the emoji of the Spies, Fridays, and Mechs, and un-ORBs the Talkers. It's brought to you by Cepheus. Note that the 'BIG SCREEN BLASEBALL' style on this page is a prereq to Compact, but was not updated to fit the 2 extra games per day that were started in Season 13.

[[Blaseball+|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blaseball-plus/]] adds functionality such as [[Reblase]] and [[Abslve]] links for Firefox. It's brought to you by leo60228.
