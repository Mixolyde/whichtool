:: renovations.sibr.dev

[[Renovations.SIBR.dev|https://renovations.sibr.dev/]] is a web visualizer to show all current and past know stadium renovation modifications, as well as to show current ballpark stats, without needing to flute between teams or purchase a pizza concession. It's brought to you by Dlareau.

All known renovations across all teams are shown at the top, and you can hover over a renovation or a ballpark stat (once expanded) to see what it does. These expanded ballpark stats are mild FK potentially, as the current Blaseball.com website does not display specific values for these visually.

Discussion of this project happens at @@.channel;#sibr-dot-dev@@ under 'Major Projects'.
