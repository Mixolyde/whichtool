:: SnaxSheet

A spreadsheet exists each season. The best place to find the current one is in the pins on @@.channel;#stats@@ on main unless we figure out some way to get this to auto-update with a new link regularly. 

Talk about this usually is in @@.channel;#ðŸ’°-economy@@ under 'Research'.

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: Reblase

[[Reblase|https://reblase.sibr.dev]] collects past game logs, future schedules, and points where players change. Brought to you by Astrid.

[[Here's the source code.|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/Reblase]] Talk about development is in @@.channel;#reblase@@ under 'Major Projects'.

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: Abslve

[[Abslve|https://slavfox.space/abslve/#SUN]] shows you star ratings for any player, by team. 

You can click the "Want that Forbidden Knowledge?" link at the bottom for unrounded stars and "apple stats", such as ruthlessness and shakesperianism. From there, you can click that "most Forbidden Knowledge" link to also see these stats for players in the Shadows.

It's robust, but somewhat unwieldy and not being actively maintained. (Indeed, its Forbidden Knowledge barriers are reflective of a time before the Apple.) A new version of this is in the works by other developers, but this is the best source we have now.

Its source code is [[here|https://github.com/slavfox/abslve]].

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: Hloroscopes

[[Hloroscopes|http://yoori.space/hloroscopes/]] plots how players' stars change over time (after events like blood drains, blessings, and the like). It's brought to you by yooori.

It includes toggles for Forbidden Knowledge and spacing of the x axis.

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: VibeCheck

[[VibeCheck|https://vibecheck.sibr.dev/]] plots player vibes by day based on our knowledge of the vibe formula. It attemps to do a team vibe as well, but currently doesn't reflect pitcher rotations correctly. It's brought to you by dlareau.

Its source code is [[here|https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/vibecheck]].

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: Chartographer

[[Chartographer|https://chartographer.sibr.dev/]] has a number of ways to compare teams against each other in the current season - the sums and averages of team stars in each of the categories, as well as Win/Loss graphs. It's brought to you by Cheeseyx.

[[I'm sorry, this isn't what I'm looking for. Let me restart.|Intro]]

:: ChartParty

[[ChartParty|http://yoori.space/chartparty]] plots win/loss charts for teams, including the option to look at past seasons. It's brought to you by yooori.
