A spreadsheet exists each season. The best place to find the current one is in the pins on @@.channel;\#stats@@ on main unless we figure out some weird way to get this to auto-update with a new link regularly. 

Talk about this usually is in @@.channel;\#ðŸ’°-economy@@ under 'Research'.

:: Reblase

[[Reblase|https://reblase.sibr.dev]] collects past game logs, future schedules, and points where players change.
