# whichtool
 Which tool from the Society for Internet Blaseball Research is right for your needs?

Accepting PRs - contact `@Kawa#7680` in `#projects` in SIBR for help or questions.

This is being built using the [Sugarcube|https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/#introduction] story format; refer to that link for most syntax questions. Github Pages should auto-compile changes from WhichTool.twee into WhichTool.html; refer to [Em LazerWalker's excellent blog on the subject|https://blog.lazerwalker.com/azure,/game/dev/2020/01/16/a-modern-developers-workflow-for-twine.html] for more info there.

An arbitrary style note: I'm trying to demarcate Discord channel names using the `.channel` style; you can wrap a channel like so:

```
@@.channel.#channel-name-here@@
```
